# Xposure

## Overview
People experience various phobias and seek therapy to overcome them, but recreating real-world stressors in a controlled setting is challenging. This makes it difficult for therapists to guide patients effectively through exposure therapy.

Our VR Exposure Therapy Simulation provides therapists with an immersive tool to gradually expose patients to anxiety-inducing environments, helping them build resilience over time.

## Features
With customizable difficulty settings, therapists can tailor each session to the patient's needs by adjusting:
- **Environmental factors** – such as crowd size, background noise, or open spaces
- **Stimulus intensity** – gradual exposure to triggers to reduce sensitivity
- **Session tracking** – measuring time spent in the environment and response patterns

This tool can be applied to various phobias, including:
- Public speaking anxiety
- Agoraphobia
- Social anxiety

By making controlled exposure more accessible, our solution enhances traditional therapy methods and improves treatment outcomes.
